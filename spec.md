# MBTA MCP Server Specification

## Overview
The MBTA MCP Server is a Machine Learning Control Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) API to provide Boston-area transit information. This server allows AI assistants to access real-time and scheduled transit data for the MBTA system, enabling users to query for transit information through conversational interfaces.

## Goals
- Provide a seamless interface between AI assistants and the MBTA API
- Enable transit information queries through natural language
- Support trip planning and route finding, including alternatives during delays
- Deliver real-time service updates and alerts

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **MCP Server Implementation**
   - Built with Go programming language
   - Uses the mcp-go module (https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go)
   - Implements stdio protocol for local usage

2. **MBTA API Integration**
   - Connects to the MBTA API v3 (https://api-v3.mbta.com/)
   - Uses API key authentication
   - Handles rate limiting and API errors according to MCP best practices

3. **Data Processing**
   - Simplifies complex MBTA API data structures for easier consumption by AI assistants
   - Formats responses as JSON
   - Processes real-time updates for service disruptions, delays, and schedule changes

### Features & Capabilities

#### Core Features
- **Transit Information Retrieval**
  - Routes and schedules
  - Real-time arrival/departure predictions
  - Service alerts and disruptions
  - Station and stop information
  - Vehicle locations
  - Accessibility information (elevator status, accessible stations)
  - Available fare information (with limitations based on API)

#### Use Cases
- **Trip Planning**
  - Find optimal routes between locations
  - Calculate estimated travel times
  - Identify transfer points

- **Service Disruption Handling**
  - Identify alternate routes during delays
  - Provide real-time updates on service status
  - Explain reasons for delays when available

- **Accessibility Information**
  - Check accessibility status of stations
  - Find accessible routes and alternatives

- **Geographic Queries**
  - Find nearest stations to locations
  - Identify routes serving specific areas or destinations

### Data Model
The server will expose simplified versions of the following MBTA API resources:
- Routes
- Stops
- Trips
- Schedules
- Predictions
- Vehicles
- Alerts
- Facilities (for accessibility information)
- Available fare information

### Error Handling
Following MCP community best practices:
- Return standardized error response objects with proper HTTP status codes
- Include descriptive error messages and error codes
- Implement graceful degradation when the MBTA API is unavailable
- Log detailed error information for troubleshooting
- Include retry mechanisms for transient errors

### Logging
Implement standard logging with multiple levels:
- Error: Critical issues that prevent operation
- Warning: Problems that don't prevent operation but require attention
- Info: General operational information
- Debug: Detailed information for troubleshooting
- Trace: Very detailed diagnostic information

## Deployment Options

### Docker Container
- Build using a minimal "FROM scratch" approach
- Include the Go binary directly
- Provide Docker Compose configuration for easy setup

### Standalone Binary
- Cross-compile for major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Provide installation and setup documentation

## Documentation

### End-User Documentation
- Installation instructions for both Docker and standalone approaches
- Configuration options
- Examples of common queries and interactions
- Troubleshooting guide

### Developer Documentation
- API reference
- Architecture overview
- Contribution guidelines
- Testing instructions

## Testing Strategy
Implement a thorough test suite including:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with the MBTA API
- End-to-end tests simulating assistant interactions
- Mocked API responses for testing error conditions

## Future Considerations
- Data caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
- Enhanced historical data analysis for route recommendations
- Expanded fare information if API support improves
- User preferences and personalization if MCP protocol supports it

## Implementation Timeline
- Immediate development with focus on core functionality first
- Iterative releases with expanding feature set
- Prioritize reliability and accuracy over comprehensive coverage initially

## Development Practices
- Follow Go best practices and idiomatic code patterns
- Implement continuous integration for automated testing
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Use semantic versioning for releases
